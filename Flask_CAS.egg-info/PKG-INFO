Description: Flask-CAS
        =========

        Flask-CAS is a Flask extension which makes it easy to
        authenticate with a CAS.

        CAS
        ===

        The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on
        protocol for the web. Its purpose is to permit a user to access
        multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as
        userid and password) only once. It also allows web applications
        to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security
        credentials, such as a password. The name CAS also refers to a
        software package that implements this protocol.

        (Very short) Setup Tutorial
        ===========================

        First create a Flask instance:

        .. code:: python

            from flask import Flask

            app = Flask(__name__)

        Apply CAS on your Flask instance:

        .. code:: python

            from flask_cas import CAS

            CAS(app)

        Do needed configuration:

        .. code:: python

            app.config['CAS_SERVER'] = 'https://sso.pdx.edu'

            app.config['CAS_AFTER_LOGIN'] = 'route_root'

        Using
        =====

        After you setup you will get two new routes `/login/`
        and `/logout/`.
